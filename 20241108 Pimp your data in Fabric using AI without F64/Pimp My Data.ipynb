Leaks all over the bathroom, there was a puddle from the moment we walked in. To top it all off, they refused to do a refund despite us staying in the room for only 2 hours, and didn't try moving to another room (like I would trust the hotel anymore.) They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.) Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess. I'll be disputing this with my bank.

Kudos to him for that but the room must have had pets in it previously because every time I stood still on the carpet, something would bite me. I assume it must have been fleas so rather than go through the hassle of changing rooms, I did not stand still on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home.

I called for an extension I was willing to pay for and they said no. I travel a lot, and that was a first.

The 30 euro breakfast was delightful. Really the only thing that seemed odd was that the lobby and hallways are not air conditioned, and the a/c in our rooms was barely adequate.

The breakfast is your basic continental breakfast, with cereal bagels, coffee, etc. The showers were hot, and the TV was the newest thing around.

There was a misunderstanding about discounts on weddings that take place during the week- evidently, they calculated the discount without letting me know what the full price was. Also, they displayed the supplement desserts and ice cream before our cake was served, which didn't make any sense and I ended up taking home most of my wedding cake. Also, reminder to brides: If your parents are part of the processional and have reserved seating, please have someone place wedding programs on their seats! Neither of our parents had programs during the service and this was disappointing and added confusion to their participation!Be aware, at the Hyatt Dulles you will pay 22% gratuity and 5% tax for all food and beverage- even the breakfast brunch, which was self serve and the omelette station wasn't manned during our brunch.

At first glance the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working was super nice. Going to the room, the elevator certificate was out of date and so was the ambiance. There is courtyard area in the middle of the hotel to sit which was nice. Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it.

When we went to our rooms the first thing we noticed were 3 fellows sitting on the side of the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler. Then when I took our girls to the pool, one is 7 and one is 14, there were 3 young men in the pool who supposedly did not speak English. There were some teenage girls leaving the pool as we came in. We later found out they were so uncomfortable by the mens stares they left until a parent could come out with them They stared at our girls until it was uncomfortable. They waited until our 14 year old went under to swim and then one dove into the pool and accidently ran into her. My husband finally came and sat by the pool so we would feel safe. Needless to say we did not swim long. Our phone did not work in our room. They finally switched the phone and the second one did not work either and they basically told us sorry about your luck there is nothing we can do. My husband messed around with the connection until he got it working. The air conditioner didn't work real well either. The room was not the cleanest, not totally filthy, but could have definately used a good scrub. The door in one room did not seem to lock tight and we moved a chair in front of it to make sure no one could get in.

They gave me lots of tips as to where to go and how to get there they even provided me with a map of Venice. They were also able to sell me all of my transit tickets, including to the airport for my return. The room was comfortable, although small and slightly outdated it was perfect for my needs. I enjoyed the hotel's location as it was much quieter than Venice. It felt very safe for me to be walking around at night and it was very convenient to get to and from Venice as there is a bus that stops directly out front. There are many good restaurants and shops around the corner that are much cheaper to eat at than in Venice if you are on a budget. I would recommend this hotel for single travelers, families or couples.

The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was especially clean. I get grossed out easily and nothing here grossed me out (I didn't even wear my flip flops in the shower). We ended up staying in two different Drury Inns over the weekend. This was our choice as the hot tub was out of order in the first hotel and we really wanted to spend the evening in a hot tub. The first night we stayed at the Drury Inn in Grove City which was a 10-15 minute drive. That hotel was recently remodeled, so the rooms there were fresh looking and had a new feel to them. The Drury Inn downtown had the same great layout, but was just older. Both places had free popcorn and soda, a free happy hour (get the wine), and served free food throughout the day, which helps you save a little on food during your stay."},{"0":"Long Beach","1":"33.78864","2":"-118.189464","3":"Best Western of Long Beach","4":"3.0","5":"The staff were very friendly and willing.

The young man at the desk found the confirmation and said it was for the 29th, I told them no it wasn't and, again, showed the reservation email. The young man told me it was 55.88, but my email told me 54.88. I said I would just pay the extra dollar. The lady asked me how many people, I told her 3. She then told me it wasn't going to be the quoted price of 54.88/ 55.88 but 69. I told her she might want to let Expedia know that the prices on Expedia's site is incorrect.

The pros - nice view of the lake, comfortable bed and nice big room with a comfy chair, desk, and free wifi. The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food, it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone...they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out...we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED! Nowhere did it mention that it's only open Fri-Sun, AND that you have pay 10/hr as a hotel guest for a bunch of bounce houses, a dirty baby area, and a ping pong table. Really While 10 an hour isn't a lot, that's exactly the point - why in the WORLD would you CHARGE your guess for this Ridiculous.

The views from Etna and Castlemola were simply breathtaking - as was the drive up narrow, winding roads! Another pleasant surprise was the quality of Sicilian wines. The luxury apartments of the Villa Carlota were first class is all respects.

There is also a simple breakfast which included the ability to make your own waffles. We had to extend our stay at the last minute and the hotel staff was very accommodating. It was also a big plus that there is a coin operated laundry onsite, that we were happy to make use of. There are good options for groceries (to fill that fridge) and dinning nearby.

Very lively pool area (loud but fun) and the rooms are delightful. Looks renovated, amazingly comfortable bed, I was on the 5th floor facing a quiet area, cute bathroom, clean and so convenient. Only thing I would have liked is a refrigerator as I'm used to the chains like Marriott and Hampton Inns etc., however, with a foodstore opposite and Starbucks plus other stores, it was no big deal. Will definitely stay there again. Will admit though that the direct rate booking through hotel website was cheaper than Expedia but it was too late, I had used Expedia for this booking.","2":"Lovely hotel and the staff are fantastic.
