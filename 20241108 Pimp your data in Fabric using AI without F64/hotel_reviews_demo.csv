Northbrook,50.106529,8.760921,Sheraton Offenbach Hotel,2.0,I was disappointed with this hotel - it is definitely not up to the normal Sheraton standard. The internet charges were overly expensive and the system they used was difficult to use. Overall the hotel rooms were dated and the air-conditioning didn't work.
Abilene,32.40399,-99.76546,Hampton Inn Abilene,3.0,"Hotel was clean but in need of an upgrade. The in room guest showed only one ice machine next to the front desk but when I went down I was told there ie only one machine and it's on the 3rd floor. It would be nice to have more than one machine in a 4 story hotel,"
Fort Collins,40.5833,-105.00756,Super 8 Fort Collins,3.0,"It was way too noisey with people in and out at all times before and during the night. Very hard to sleep. The smoking area right outside the door that I had to walk through, always had 2-3 people and I think the smoking area should be moved away from the building."
Lavonia,34.444512,-83.120563,Hotel Lavonia,1.0,"The motel was mostly vacant. There apparently had been a flooded room as fans were operating in the hallway. Not a pleasant odor. Room was only passable. I probably won't be in the area again, but if I was, I wouldn't stay there."
Coralville,41.70064,-91.607,Americinn Coralville,5.0,"Honestly, we had a great night, room was clean, ac worked perfectly, guest service was great and nobody bothered us... Plus the local area is safe and full of foods spots. What more could you ask for Definitely worth it paying in advance because you'll save around 10. Thanks guys"
Bossier City,32.52313,-93.70201,Quality Inn and Suites,4.0,"Desk clerk was courteous and helpful,beds were very comfortable the only downside was we were placed next to a connecting room and the person was on the phone talking very loud very early in the morning"
Boone,42.035281,-93.876328,Baymont Inn and Suites Boone,4.0,"The breakfast had a good selection of foods. We stayed here because it had a swimming pool. It was inside, but it was not heated. After 20 minutes we had to get out because the little kids were shivering so badly. We thought it might have a hot tub, but it didn't. We thought we were going to have queen beds, but they were only double. The staff was friendly enough. The stay was OK but a bit overpriced for what we thought we were getting."
Medina,37.850643,15.293988,Villa Carlotta,5.0,Excellent. A small and charming hotel located in the upper part of Taormina with breathtaking views of the Mediterranean and Etna.
Harrisburg,40.277723,-76.821103,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,2.0,"First -- Expedia allowed me to select 2 queen beds but apparently, this is not truly an option through Expedia so I was reserved for 1 King bed for 4 people. (I did end up getting 2 queens). Room is small and standard - 2 beds, desk, chair, big TV, mini fridge. The hotel room was damp and musty. Even with all the lights on and window shades open, the room is dark. There was definitely a smell in the room."
West Deptford,39.83456,-75.08841,Residence Inn By Marriott Deptford,5.0,We stayed at this hotel since my daughter had a 3 day swim meet at GCIT. The hotel room was spotless and bed was extremely comfortable. We had great shower pressure and my daughter loved swimming in the pool between her sessions. As always loved having the kitchen for early breakfasts and late night dinners. Unfortunately we only ate the free breakfast once due to time constraints in the morning. Breakfast was very good with a good selection of hot and cold foods. Would absolutely stay at this hotel again.
Grand Rapids,42.91294,-85.5323,Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,5.0,"We frequently stay at this hotel. The staff is wonderful, clean rooms and pool area. You get a 15 percent discount at Branns Restaurant next door when you tell them your stating at the Best Western ! They too have great food and service! If I had to say I could better one thing about our stay it would have to be that the hot tub jets do not bubble the hot tub , they only blow. That is the main purpose and reason many do enjoy a hot tub. Other than that I give this Best western 5 stars! Let me add they have a really good breakfast bar as well free w stay! Always reasonable priced stay!"
Bangor,44.791314,-68.810204,Days Inn Bangor Airport,5.0,Stayed 1 night went to the Darling Waterfront on Aug 12. The staff was so friendly called the local cab company for a cab to the concert. there a Ground Round next door and plenty of parking.Plus free breakfast. If going to a concert great location.Customer Service A1
Telluride,37.933273,-107.850865,Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,5.0,"Parking is $20 per night no matter what, but there's a shuttle to take you around the area and the rooms are pretty nice. Check out the pool and hot tub"
Cranberry Twp,40.67519,-80.10058,Hyatt Place Pittsburgh Cranberry,4.0,"We were in between college visits and the Hyatt Place was the perfect stop for us. The hotel was clean, the breakfast was plentiful and delicious and the rooms were big for our family of 4."
Irvine,33.67971,-117.837279,Residence Inn By Marriott Irvine John Wayne Airport,3.0,"Stayed here for a combo business/family trip. The weather was hot and the room was warm when we checked in. The A/C struggled to cool the room overnight, but finally by morning the temp was comfortable. There was no hotel or area info in the room - you're directed to a calendar card on your fridge and a large touchscreen... More"
Telluride,37.933273,-107.850865,Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,5.0,"What a great family vacations in this beautiful place! Cabins are cozy, beautiful deco. The gondola view is simply amazing. If you are planning to go, try to do it the first few days of June to enjoy the Balloon festival."
Meridian,32.350392,-88.691659,La Quinta Inn and Suites Meridian,2.0,"Underwhelmed. This hotel smells bad, has some loud, partying guests. Front desk was very nice, but the rest of the staff seems to let the riff raff run rampant. I didn't feel safe (as a female) being in the parking lot alone. As a frequent guest of La Quinta, this location was well below my expectations."
San Antonio,29.487838,-98.583884,Fiesta Inn and Suites,1.0,Arrived at 9:00 pm no towels door hinge screws were loose making it difficult to shut door cable was not working roach infested big advertisement of Continental Breakfast but in the morning no sign of any breakfast went to front desk again for towels they still didn't have available front desk receptionist more interested on visiting with friends that were at her work.
Grand Rapids,42.91294,-85.5323,Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,1.0,"Filthy room, drunk adults and teenagers wandering the hallways, paper thin walls. We were relocating for my work and had a four night reservation. Cancelled it an hour after arrival and spent a miserable night"
Northbrook,50.106529,8.760921,Sheraton Offenbach Hotel,4.0,"fourth visit - good location for my business needs Helpful, friendly staff. Tube stop markt-platz right next to hotel."
Prescott Valley,34.585531,-112.326875,Arizona Inn of Prescott Valley,5.0,"It's hard to find a reasonably priced hotel that doesn't smell musty, including non-smoking rooms. We were pleasantly surprised by the clean fresh smell and the room temperature was perfect. We were pleased with the continental breakfast and it's many choices. We'll come back again."
Ashburn,53.566245,9.988144,Hotel Vorbach,3.0,The room was nice and comfortable but the service went from good to bad as soon as I told them I booked with hotels.com. They told me for one hour they havent got the booking and normaly it doesnt take more than 10 minutes. After I called hotels.com and they send a new confirmation I got a room.
Palermo,38.160424,13.331846,Hotel Casena Dei Colli,5.0,"La struttura molto bella , la colazione troppo scarsa per il livello del hotel Manca la scelta di yogurt e alimenti naturali Assente il bio e per il celiaco Assente la colazione internazionale ( uova ,pancetta e varie) Dolci per essere la Sicilia scarsi"
Irving,48.856543,2.285148,H  tel Sezz Paris,4.0,"The double room was too small even for a two night stay. Upgraded it a Suite and was spacious, quite and comfortable. A bit far from touristic attractions, the hotel is located in a nice residential area close to Trocadero. Metro station just 2min walk away."
Fort Lauderdale,26.123981,-80.331315,La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,3.0,"When I got there I was informed by the guy at the front desk, Nathan, that my room with a king sized bed was overbooked and only two double beds were available. Since I was not happy about that, he then checked to see what he could do and found a room with a king bed. Kudos to him for that but the room must have had pets in it previously because every time I stood still on the carpet, something would bite me. I assume it must have been fleas so rather than go through the hassle of changing rooms, I did not stand still on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home. I told the girl at the desk about the issue so hopefully the room was properly cleaned and treated. Shame on the pet owners who bring their bug infested pets into a hotel room making it worse for the next guest."
Port Clinton,41.52469,-82.85883,Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Stes Port Clinton-catawba Island,4.0,Excellent Our stay was very enjoyable. The staff were very attentive. The hotel itself is very warm and inviting. The complimentary breakfast excellent.
Fort Lauderdale,26.123981,-80.331315,La Quinta Inn and Suites Sunrise,5.0,"location in a little tough to navigate as it only in approachable from one way and exiting can be slightly tricky. However, the hotel room was clean, nice, and the bathroom was decent. The breakfast was a good assortment of dry goods to choose from."
Park City,40.65143,-111.50604,Marriott's Mountainside At Park City,4.0,"Lovely hotel but some annoying downfalls. 1. We were not advised of the check-out time which was unusually early, 10am. So as we were still relaxing in the room, housekeeping kept attempting to gain access to the room - still never mentioning that we should have checked out at 10am. I had to call the reception to ask them why we were being constantly bothered by housekeeping, only then did we find out the crazy early check out time. Very annoying!!!!!!! 2. There was no bar at the hotel but we were able to purchase wine from the lobby shop. After we ordered what we wanted and went to the room, the reception called to advise that the only red wine they now had was the most expensive one (almost double the others!) Very annoying !!! The hotel itself was nice, great location and nice pool area but the service was not great - maybe because it was out of season..."
Columbia,38.96124,-92.28914,Howard Johnson Inn Columbia,4.0,My friends and I enjoyed the hotel. The staff was helpful and got us set up with a nice taxi service. The room serves its purpose of a place to get ready for a concert and then come back late and get some good sleep before heading home.
Las Vegas,36.171617,-115.146375,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,1.0,I was not happy with the stay. The room looked bad. The TV didn't work and bed sheets had stains. AC didn't work properly. I will never go back and stay there.
San Bruno,37.617582,-122.408516,Hotel Aura Sfo,5.0,"We always stay in the general area as it is in a convenient for our visits. We've never stayed here at this particular hotel but were very satisfied with the accommodations and the price was with-in our budget. The room was clean, staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was the standard that you may find in many hotels of this level, make your own pancakes, cereal and juice,ect. I had problems connecting my computer to the wi-fi, but the lady at the front desk was very helpful and got me on line. Probably just me and my own ignorance on computers. Overall we were very satisfied and would stay here again."
Houston,29.768461,-95.459631,The Houstonian Hotel,5.0,The most relaxing beautiful hotel in Houston. Service is exceptional and staff is excellent. Spa is the best inTexas....
Sarasota,27.300319,-82.450461,Hampton Inn Sarasota - I-75 Bee Ridge,1.0,"the room was very muggy and humid. There was a air purifier in the room but it was working. It was finally changed after the second request, in which the front desk person had to change it out himself. the Carpet looked clean but it was very dirty. My daughter walked around the room barefoot for an hour and her... More"
Westmont,41.81644,-87.955,Extended Stay America - Chicago - Westmont - Oak Brook,3.0,"This hotel isn't bad per se, it's just very dated. If they did some updates in the rooms and made a few little changes, the prices they charge would be justified. Good things: decent location, quiet neighborhood, not too far from the city. Annoying things: the wifi is pretty bad during the day, the rooms are dated, the bed was pretty darn bad, their version of a continental breakfast consists of low-grade muffins and coffee, and they make you check out at 11am and don't allow late check-outs. I called for an extension I was willing to pay for and they said no. I travel a lot, and that was a first. This place advertises dishes and cutlery for your room (they have kitchens), but none was supplied. In my opinion, all those things arent too bad, but more so inconveniences. That's all I have. But on a side note, James at the front desk is amazing!"
Newburgh,41.505388,-74.073291,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,1.0,"I've stayed in this hotel twice before with no issues. However, this time when we checked in our room it had a pungent smell.. As of they were trying to mask the smell. There were bugs crawling on the table, I awoke one morning to a huge spider on my pillow looking at me and lastly.. The bathroom had tiny hairs on floor and shower wall. Was truely disgusted with my stay!"
Santa Barbara,34.428888,-119.707704,Simpson House Inn,5.0,Just walk onto the grounds and you know this is something superior. The service is impeccable. The food is wonderful. The rooms are more than comfortable. And the grounds are Edenic. You just feel like you have entered something special. It may be the best place I have ever stayed.
Long Beach,33.78864,-118.189464,Best Western of Long Beach,3.0,It was a good place to stay as the train stopped right outside and would take you closer to the action. Breakfast was ordinary as our many American continental breakfasts. Room was comfortable as you would expect.
Tucson,32.124926,-110.934519,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,3.0,"great staff service you expect at hampton, but the facility is not top notch, and the breakfast was a disappointment. Breakfast was not up to hampton standards, few selections and not variety i have found at other hotels."
Curitiba,-25.43675,-49.28146,Mercure Curitiba Golden Hotel,5.0,"Hotel excelente, muito limpo e organizado, localizao perfeita (prximo a bares, restaurantes e shoppings). Quartos amplos, cama excelente, ducha muito boa e caf da manh muito bom com muitas variedades. Equipe bastante atenciosa e simptica."
San Antonio,29.487838,-98.583884,Fiesta Inn and Suites,3.0,"Refrigerator was barley cool. Iron would barley warm up. Phone wouldn't ring. Hair dryer was faulty. No wash cloths - only old, rough towels. No enforcement of pool rules. Spend the extra cash for a better place."
Grand Junction,39.067321,-108.569141,Hampton Inn Grand Junction Downtown/historic Main Street,5.0,"This was for a one night stop while traveling. The area is great. Lots of restaurant choices in walking distance and the breakfast at the hotel was fantastic with a lot of choices. The hotel and room were clean, beds comfortable and staff was nice. Not to mention the fresh baked cookies in the lobby."
Tucson,32.124926,-110.934519,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,2.0,"excellent hotel; very convenient to the tucson airport, and they serve a wide variety of items for breakfast (which is complimentary)."
Carson City,39.142715,-119.767824,Americas Best Value Inn,4.0,"Stayed at this motel while playing a softball tournament in north Tahoe upon arrival very easy check in the hotel is a old hotel but kept as well as it can be. Clean very quite nice people ,pool is very old but wAter is clean. No fridge and micro like they said and breakfast was horrible . Landry facilities are great and open all night which is great since we got back late and had softball uniforms to wash over all great place to stay!"
Las Vegas,36.171617,-115.146375,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,1.0,Horrible! Dirty halls - piles of trash dirty linens laid in hall all night long. (see pics). Very strict checkout policy - told me if I stayed 5 minutes past 11am I would be billed another 22.
Cambridge,42.374972,-71.110408,A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,5.0,"Everything about the place was above and beyond what I needed and expected it to be. The house is in a great spot, within walking distance of most of Harvard, and close to the Harvard T-station, so easy to get around. Breakfasts were always delicious, as the innkeeper is a wonderful chef. Great food and food for thought in the morning, with many interesting stories and ideas exchanged. Rooms were really nice, and the bed was very comfortable. Shared bathroom was always clean and tidy, and never busy/no waiting for the shower. A/C kept the room cool, temperature was never a problem. Innkeeper was always accommodating and very easy-going. Would definitely stay here again."
Fort Lauderdale,26.096485,-80.246321,Extended Stay America - Fort Lauderdale - Davie,3.0,"The staff are wonderful. Thats not my complaint. The room just wasnt great. The floors in the bathroom are stained. The shower has 2 heads and one wont shut off all the way. The room just doesnt feel as clean as it should. For the price, this room just lacks what we expected."
Denver,39.744501,-104.983568,Warwick Denver,4.0,"Very comfortable bed. Food was great pool was warm and fun although very crowded with what dis not appear to be hotel guests playing loud music. Did not get service one day and the other day it was after 4:00. Okay, but not ideal."
San Antonio,29.487838,-98.583884,Fiesta Inn and Suites,1.0,Rude and angry staff could not figure out how to use the computer.  He kept looking through stacks of papers and yelling at customers because we did not have printouts from Expedia to prove we had a reservation.  I called help desk and then the clerk yelled at him for 5 minutes.  Then Expedia explained that they could not help me get a new hotel room until the clerk agreed to refund Expedia.  So no room and no money - but Expedia did offer my a $50 credit.  So I was stranded in San Antonio at 1 in the morning with a credit - soooooo helpful.  I asked to talk to a supervisor - was told that there was a 45 minute wait.  Hummm I guess the long wait is because none of your customers are happy.
Grand Rapids,42.91294,-85.5323,Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,4.0,"This is the motel we prefer when going downstate to visit family and friends in the Grand Rapids area The interstate is right there and a plethora of restaurants surround the location on busy 28th St., not to mention the close proximity to two major malls. Room was clean and the bed very comfortable. Plus the wife was pleased with... More"
Black River Falls,44.29782,-90.82021,Comfort Inn and Suites,5.0,"We enjoyed our stay, brief as it was. The front desk customer service representatives were exceptional, particularly the young lady (I'm sorry we did not get her name) when we checked in the evening of Jan. 22, 2015."
Fort Collins,40.5833,-105.00756,Super 8 Fort Collins,4.0,"Hotel staff was very attentive and pleasant, although, the front desk was not staffed unless called with the buzzer. The morning breakfast was very good. The staff seemed to do a good job of keeping the facility clean, but some of the hotel guests dumped their trash and dirty towels outside of room doors for pickup and vomit was present in the stairwell and outside the back door. The AC was difficult to moderate and would shut down due to energy saving measures when someone was not in the room. This caused the room to always take a period of time to get comfortable again. The entrance to and from the main road in front was not always easy."
Lithia Springs,45.43393,12.34551,Hotel Metropole,4.0,"The room was beautiful, very dark because of the location, had an extra guest visit for one night and was charged dearly for it."
Meridian,32.350392,-88.691659,La Quinta Inn and Suites Meridian,3.0,Management and staff were fantastic. I'd come back again. My only complaint has to do with a family who wouldn't control their dog or kids. It was a bit noisy. But that wasn't the hotel's fault. Was a nice stay.
Fort Worth,32.73509,-97.43459,Hampton Inn & Suites Fort Worth-west-i-30,5.0,The room we stayed in was very spacious. It had lots and lots of room to move around. The set-up was nice too. The room was kind of separated by a built in middle desk that had the tv above it. The tv could be turned to face the bed side of the room or to the couch/visiting side. Nice... More

West Deptford,39.83456,-75.08841,Residence Inn By Marriott Deptford,4.0,"We stayed overnight after going to see George Benson in concert at the TD Bank Art Center. The hotel is very conveniently located near restaurants and places to shop. The hotel lobby is kind of small, but when we checked in it was kind of empty so that really didn't matter. The staff behind the counter was pleasant. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. We would definetely stay again."
Fort Wayne,41.13243,-85.15651,Days Inn Fort Wayne,4.0,"I have stayed at this Days Inn every time I am in Fort Wayne, The people that run the motel are great people and care very much about there place. The 4 star is for Location, Rate, and Room in that order."

Brookings,44.31141,-96.76286,Days Inn Brookings,3.0,"The motel has an inside swim park and when you walk in you can smell the chlorine throughout the facility. The facility is undergoing some remodeling which it is need of as it has the interior appearance of about a 20 year old facility. The t.v,s are still the old type. Breakfast facility was very roomy and quite nice."
West Yarmouth,41.657447,-70.261804,Tidewater Inn,3.0,"Could use some cosmetic updates-new rugs, bedspreads , curtains etc Was initially disappointed with room but they are clean and housekeeping staff terrific All staff at hotel were wonderful to deal with Please fix indoor pool locks so key to open works easily-wiggling key a pain Onsite caf great-food and wait staff terrific-great coffee Close to everything so great location For the price would stay again"
North Myrtle Beach,33.791179,-78.734704,Beach Cove 411 Tower A Sierra's 1 Bedroom Condo By Prista Management,5.0,"This facility is very well kept, up to date, and clean. Enjoyed our stay very much. I am very picky about where we stay. A friend referred us to Beach Cove. It is a great location and very family friendly. Staff was very friendly helpful."
Effingham,39.14055,-88.565983,Super 8 - Effingham,3.0,Motel and room were fine. When we checked in the front desk staff was busy discussing their schedule for Christmas and we had to stand and wait until they decided to take care of us. Not very professional front desk staff.
Hillsboro,45.532877,-122.920863,Holiday Inn Express - Hillsboro,4.0,Hotel was up to Holiday Inn Express standards. Quiet cul de sac. Driving distance for local restaurants. Close to employment centers.
Englewood,41.000606,28.802515,Radisson Blu Conference and Airport Hotel,1.0,The place does not deserve more than 3 stars at best if not 2. Staff untrained and disorganized. The room was not as good as the photos.
Telluride,37.933273,-107.850865,Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,5.0,"Couldn't be a better location for the Mountain Village Gondola into Telluride (which is a beautiful ride!) The price for our June trip was great, too! The front desk staff was friendly and accommodating as we added a day to the trip."
Fond Du Lac,43.75521,-88.47649,Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,4.0,While it appeared to be an older facility it was in very good repair. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Everything worked. Nice included breakfast buffet goes beyond what many 'free breakfasts' provide. Good value.
Jackson,43.48286,-110.76506,Anglers Inn,4.0,"The room was clean and nicely decorated in a cabin style. Our room was in the older section of the Inn, on the lower floor at the end, and the noise from the water pipes for that entire section was quite constant, plus the people in the room above us seemed to be constantly walking back and forth across the room and we could hear every step!"
Atlantic Beach,34.701386,-76.74691,Palm Suites,3.0,The stay was ok but our room had black mold on the ceiling above the air conditioner. I ask for a different room but it was booked for the festival on Friday. The clerk said that she may have one on Saturday but i was never contacted.
Idaho Falls,43.49497,-112.052329,Fairfield Inn and Suites By Marriott Idaho Falls,5.0,"We chose this hotel as a rendezvous place before and after a trip with friends to Yellowstone.

San Francisco,37.799801,-122.436031,Chelsea Inn,4.0,"Had my doubts but the office clerks were very helpful and any problems were quickly resolved. The room was clean and did not smell of air freshner. The location is excellent as it is one block from Chestnut St. where there are lots of restaurants, shopping, ATMs and bars. We had a large van and there was plenty of room to park it. One afternoon the office staff even parked it for us as the parking slot was not available when we checked in. Very nice experience!"
Jackson,43.48286,-110.76506,Anglers Inn,3.0,"Hotel is not upscale, but adequate. It's location is good and walking distance from downtown Jackson. The room is relatively small, but ok since we spent all daytime hours site seeing. Price was right!"
Walker,47.09124,-94.57172,Country Inn Walker,5.0,"Booked an hour before we arrived with no previous experience of the location of the chain. Entrance is like a country house, with a large open and welcoming reception area. prompt check-in and directed towards a pot of chilli that was available for guests (despite offering breakfast only). Access to first floor is by stairs only, but they are wide... More"
New Orleans,29.9632203,-90.059329,Lamothe House,4.0,Our room was nice customer service was very good the floors in the room were very dirty though don't think they ever mopped them!
Windom,43.856357,-95.116243,Red Carpet Inn,2.0,Sink faucet handle was extremely loose. (Very simple to fix.) Toilet handle was extremely loose. (Very simple to fix.) Pillows were stained and filthy. Room smelled musty. Outside paint on window frames - - wasn't. Desk clerk was uncooperative.
Coralville,41.70064,-91.607,Americinn Coralville,2.0,"It was an overnight travel stay. Our room was like a sauna. The sheets were wet, towels wet. Hotel staff said leave the air conditioner on, it'll get better. It didn't. As we left, Noticed water condensing on the outside wall on both sides of our window. No other window had it. Probably faulty condenser. Just made our stay miserable."
Chico,39.72602,-121.83713,Americas Best Value Inn,2.0,"The first room I was placed in looked like something out of a horror movie. The window was broken in the open position... On the ground level facing the alley way. They placed me in a new room on the second floor that was better. I asked for a late check out ( which they said was no problem, but costs 10 per hour over). They forgot I was scheduled a late check out and called and started to berate me because I hadn't checked out yet... When I reminded them, they apologized and were nice. Only to have house keeping knock on my door a couple minutes later and we went through the same scenario."
Northbrook,50.106529,8.760921,Sheraton Offenbach Hotel,5.0,Hotel was very central with easy access to rail links to airport. Very close to river Main for some superb riverside walks. Food was. Expensive in hotel so we tended to eat out. Tea and coffee facilities in room should be standard in a four star hotel.
Northbrook,50.106529,8.760921,Sheraton Offenbach Hotel,5.0,"Staff at Sheraton made our experience wonderful, would definitely recommend to anyone considering this hotel. Well located for walking ventures to Offenbach outside locations a like via the train station (Marketplaz). Easily located via train when leaving Franfurt Airport."
Annapolis,38.97555,-76.54838,Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,5.0,Friendly staff. Nice facility. Great location. We would stay at the Hampton Inn Suites Annapolis again.
Lithia Springs,45.43393,12.34551,Hotel Metropole,4.0,"This was the most expensive hotel we stayed in during our 10 days in Italy. At US 750 per night, it is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in, anywhere. The location is great, the staff is fantastic, and arranged for our transportation from the airport when we arrived and to the train station when we left. The public areas and rooms were lovely. The 30 euro breakfast was delightful. Really the only thing that seemed odd was that the lobby and hallways are not air conditioned, and the a/c in our rooms was barely adequate. We are from Houston and were surprised that a hotel of this caliber and price point had this sort of issue. Overall, delightful."
Miles City,46.39733,-105.82263,Econo Lodge Miles City,4.0,"This hotel has NO pet fee, which was a fantastic perk during our cross-country journey with our dog. Everything else about this 'outdoor' hotel (no indoor hallways) is mediocre. We had been driving all day and most of the night and just needed a place to lay our heads. It served its purpose. The breakfast is your basic continental breakfast, with cereal bagels, coffee, etc. The showers were hot, and the TV was the newest thing around. They also had microwaves and fridges near a table, which made a perfect spot to eat our late night dinner. The staff was friendly and helpful. If you are not concerned with luxury, this is a great place for pet owners and non-owners alike!"
Santa Cruz,36.965324,-122.021465,Fireside Inn Santa Cruz,5.0,"This is the second time I've stayed at the FI. This stay, I was there for six nights. The FI, is what it is advertised to be. Basic, clean, safe and comfortable. Extremely close to the beach (one of the closest hotels to the beach). The staff have always been good and attentive. I have no complaints and when I need or want to stay in Santa Cruz, this will be my home away from home until."
Fort Worth,32.73509,-97.43459,Hampton Inn & Suites Fort Worth-west-i-30,5.0,"This hotel is in a great location with easy access to Interstate 30. Close to a mall and restaurants. It is very clean, friendly and very helpful staff. The rooms are a good size, clean and the pillows are great. I definitely would stay here again."
Coralville,41.70064,-91.607,Americinn Coralville,1.0,My family and I have stayed here several times in the past this last time was horrible.

Stone Creek,41.08352,1.153677,Hotel Portaventura,3.0,"Great location and access to the Theme Park and ability to come and go through out the day was excellent. Rooms large and functional and clean Dining options limited and food quality disappointing, breakfast buffet passable - definitely not 4 star. The hotel is fine but don't expect 4 star standards."
Livermore,37.701428,-121.814181,Comfort Inn Livermore,3.0,"Stayed one night and found that the hotel is basic yet comfortable for a night or two.Very close to highway, yet quiet."
Studio City,34.144791,-118.41155,Sportsmen's Lodge,4.0,"Lovely hotel and the staff are fantastic. I called to try for a last minute reservation the morning of my check in. Spoke to by far the nicest man by the name of Howard. He was humorous, helpful and took my phone number down to call and let me know if I could check in early. I did manage to do an earlier check in and the entire front desk crew were incredible. Very lively pool area (loud but fun) and the rooms are delightful. Looks renovated, amazingly comfortable bed, I was on the 5th floor facing a quiet area, cute bathroom, clean and so convenient. Only thing I would have liked is a refrigerator as I'm used to the chains like Marriott and Hampton Inns etc., however, with a foodstore opposite and Starbucks plus other stores, it was no big deal. Will definitely stay there again. Will admit though that the direct rate booking through hotel website was cheaper than Expedia but it was too late, I had used Expedia for this booking."
Rockford,42.27388,-88.9672,Extended Stay America - Rockford - I-90,3.0,"We traveled to Rockford for a soccer tournament at the last minute. The hotel is located in an area with many other hotels and places to eat and we booked it because it was recently remodeled. I rated the hotel higher than my wife because she thinks the quality of the bedding says a lot about the hotel In our room we found fresh paint, carpeting etc. however the appliances, bedding and shower were not upgraded. All in all still a nice place but would have been top notch if they would have gone the next steps."
Santa Barbara,34.409581,-119.693387,Casa Del Mar Inn Bandb,4.0,"The hotel was 1/2 block from the beach. No pool which was a bummer. Overall a clean nice property. Short walk to food, beach, and retail."
Charlotte,35.30077,-80.7538,Country Inn and Suites By Carlson Charlotte University Place,4.0,"Comfortable accommodations and friendly, excellent staff. Stayed for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hot breakfast changed each day and there were plenty of options. Definitely worth another stay the next time in the area."
Orlando,28.482007,-81.455546,Extended Stay America - Orlando Theme Parks - Vineland Rd.,3.0,Be ready to make your own bed and hang up those towels if you are staying just a few nights. Room service does not kick in until after a week. Guess that's why they call it EXTENDED stay. lol
Herndon,,,Hyatt Dulles,4.5,"Gyn was fabulous and very detail oriented- she executed our wedding and rehearsal dinner very well and worked very hard to make sure that things went smoothly- she and her staff made the room look beautiful with the many accessories I brought- photo collage, table scape confetti, etc. She was also very flexible and easy to work with.There were just a couple issues to be aware of- read the contract very carefully before signing, or better yet, have whomever is paying sign the contract. There was a misunderstanding about discounts on weddings that take place during the week- evidently, they calculated the discount without letting me know what the full price was. Also, they displayed the supplement desserts and ice cream before our cake was served, which didn't make any sense and I ended up taking home most of my wedding cake. Also, reminder to brides: If your parents are part of the processional and have reserved seating, please have someone place wedding programs on their seats! Neither of our parents had programs during the service and this was disappointing and added confusion to their participation!Be aware, at the Hyatt Dulles you will pay 22% gratuity and 5% tax for all food and beverage- even the breakfast brunch, which was self serve and the omelette station wasn't manned during our brunch. This was very overpriced and there wasn't much service to justify this exorbitant fee."
Auburn,42.199763,-71.840633,La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,3.0,"Positives: convenient to highway, close to restaurants, across from Auburn Mall, friendly staff, all public areas (lobby,dining area,hallways) clean, free wifi,good size room,roombathroom clean,hot water in shower,comfortable bed, free breakfast, good variety of breakfast foods, price is comparable to nearby hotels.

The continental breakfast is ok to... More"
Huntersville,35.44025,-80.87268,Candlewood Suites Huntersville,1.0,The furniture was in bad shape and disgusting. I stayed for 4 days and no one ever came and cleaned my room. I also asked for new towels and never got them. I also had to take out my own trash every day.
Gardena,33.886224,-118.309143,Gardena Terrace Inn,3.0,"The Gardena Terrace Inn was just a one night stay for us. At first glance the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working was super nice. Going to the room, the elevator certificate was out of date and so was the ambiance. There is courtyard area in the middle of the hotel to sit which was nice. Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it. Kudos to the workers for being so kind and I'm sure the amenities would have been refilled if we had asked."
Rohnert Park,38.3636,-122.71498,Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,4.0,"New management made a great change! For a discount property, it was clean and comfortable. We were met by Jonathan and Mariella who were professional, courteous and very friendly. Whatever we asked they had an answer. Definitely worth a revisit"
Gresham,49.802514,9.921491,Ibis Wuerzburg City,3.0,"Het hotel bevind zich echt aan de buitenkant van de stad. Lastig parkeren en ook lastig te vinden met de tomtom. Maar beschikt over alles, vriendelijk personeel. Prima hotel voor een overnachting tussen twee bestemmingen door. Geen klachten!!"
San Antonio,29.487838,-98.583884,Fiesta Inn and Suites,2.0,"Last minute incident caused us to stay at this local hotel and since it was only going to be for one night and we are locals, I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a room. With that being said, the place was kind of eerie and the room was dirty. Floors were dirty, shower curtain was full of hair and mildew and room over all had a lingering smoke smell (room was non-smoking). We survived the night but I won't be going back to stay there and unfortunately, I can't say I would recommend this place either."
Coalville,40.91089,-111.40339,Best Western Holiday Hills,2.0,I was working out of town so I got a hotel that would allow me to be close and get some extra sleep. I arrived at the hotel just before Midnight. The first time the fire alarm malfunctioned was just after 6:30 a.m. It happened twice after that do the extra sleep I paid 80 to get didn't happen. When I tried to express this to the woman at the front desk she wasn't too concerned.
Irving,48.886905,2.300571,Best Western Hotel De Neuville,5.0,"Lovely clean, warm hotel, good advice and information for local attractions, and great value for money. Good variety breakfast. Ideal location close to restaurants."
Pittsburgh,40.4461,-79.7139,Super 8 Pittsburgh/monroeville,1.0,"I had trouble requesting a non-smoking room on the website. When I arrived at the hotel and said I would prefer a non-smoking room, I was told that they didn't have to accomidate me because I booked my room through Hotels.com."
Prescott Valley,34.585531,-112.326875,Arizona Inn of Prescott Valley,4.0,"Had a nice little two day getaway with my significant other. The hotel was great value for the price, it was a great fit for our trip and I'll keep it in mind for future trips"
Portland,47.939428,1.892902,Inter-hotel Orl  ans Nord,4.0,"Our main problem with this hotel was trying to find it in the dark! There were no directions given with the confirmation from Hotels.com and the map provided did not show enough detail. Having eventually got there, we were most impressed by the service provided by the manager on duty (Gary) who did all he could to help. The restaurant had good food at very reasonable prices but the breakfast, again good, was a little more expensive than average."
San Francisco,37.799801,-122.436031,Chelsea Inn,3.0,"The hotel staff was very friendly. The rooms were well kept. The prices were decent, not great, and the neighborhood was so so. Some good food in the area, but there's an extremely noisy bar directly next to the hotel. No options for room service, and the pillows were pretty uncomfortable. They do offer one free parking space for your vehicle, which is unusual for San Francisco. All and all, I might stay there again, but there are better options."
Blythewood,34.21438,-80.97437,Days Inn North Columbia Ft. Jackson,3.0,"Luckily we were only here overnight. We had 2 rooms for 6 people. We asked for adjoining rooms but did not even get rooms on the same floor. When we went to our rooms the first thing we noticed were 3 fellows sitting on the side of the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler. Then when I took our girls to the pool, one is 7 and one is 14, there were 3 young men in the pool who supposedly did not speak English. There were some teenage girls leaving the pool as we came in. We later found out they were so uncomfortable by the mens stares they left until a parent could come out with them They stared at our girls until it was uncomfortable. They waited until our 14 year old went under to swim and then one dove into the pool and accidently ran into her. My husband finally came and sat by the pool so we would feel safe. Needless to say we did not swim long. Our phone did not work in our room. They finally switched the phone and the second one did not work either and they basically told us sorry about your luck there is nothing we can do. My husband messed around with the connection until he got it working. The air conditioner didn't work real well either. The room was not the cleanest, not totally filthy, but could have definately used a good scrub. The door in one room did not seem to lock tight and we moved a chair in front of it to make sure no one could get in. We asked for one room to be switched but was told no the owner would not want to."

West Memphis,35.160223,-90.15817,Days Inn West Memphis,4.0,"Wonderful room, was upstairs and we prefer downstairs viewing Southland Gaming Park, not complaining on that. We were in room 262 and I did put the Do not disturb hanger on door so they wouldn't knock too early, we didn't get any housekeeping either day we were there day, I had to go get clean towels take garbage out and get more room coffee and creamer that's all that I wasn't to crazy about, but I will take the blame for that cause I did put the sign Do Not Disturb on door the first day, actually I thought they would clean it after we left though!"

Hopkinsville,36.81071,-87.49478,La Quinta Inn and Suites Hopkinsville,4.0,"We drove all day and needed a room for the night. I was able to book the room online en route and snagged a great discount. Despite major road construction at the exit off the parkway, we were able to find the hotel fine. The front desk attendant was very helpful in suggesting a restaurant that would deliver at the late hour we had arrived. He also showed us where the breakfast kitchen set up was but he didn't mention the amazing selection of food we had to choose from! Our room was very comfortable in size. The beds were very comfortable with soft and luxurious bedding! The bathroom was spa like! The adjustable massaging shower head was perfect to end the long day of driving! I hated to leave! If all LaQuintas are as nice as this one in Hopkinsville, I will never book anywhere else!"

Anaheim,33.796738,-117.915091,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,1.0,"While the location is great as it has free parking and is located within walking distance to one of the Disney parking areas with a free shuttle, that was about the only thing remarkable about this hotel. The room was dated and had the bare minimum done to make it worth sleeping in. Continental breakfast did have fresh waffles but other than than, toast, cereal, juice and milk were about all that was offered to go with it. Fortunately, there is a Denny's right next door. They may be doing some remodeling but what we saw on our stay was not enough to make me want to stay there again. Room price was relatively cheap compared to many others but worth it to pay more for a decent place to sleep."

They gave me lots of tips as to where to go and how to get there they even provided me with a map of Venice. They were also able to sell me all of my transit tickets, including to the airport for my return. The room was comfortable, although small and slightly outdated it was perfect for my needs. I enjoyed the hotel's location as it was much quieter than Venice. It felt very safe for me to be walking around at night and it was very convenient to get to and from Venice as there is a bus that stops directly out front. There are many good restaurants and shops around the corner that are much cheaper to eat at than in Venice if you are on a budget. I would recommend this hotel for single travelers, families or couples. I enjoyed my stay!"
Austin,30.416106,-97.744278,Hilton Garden Inn Austin Nw - Arboretum,4.0,"I found the Hilton Garden Inn to be quite pleasant despite it's location along a very busy Hwy 183 corridor. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly. The WiFi worked great. There was some renovations going on during our stay, but it did not hinder us moving about the hotel. My only comment is that the windows weren't very soundproof so we did have some highway noise make its way into our room, but it wasn't detrimental so as to impact our stay."
Sulphur,30.21369,-93.32655,Crossland Economy Studios - Lake Charles - Sulphur,1.0,"Walls and ceiling had cracks. Was terrified ceiling was going to cave in, so couldn't sleep. Bed not big enough for 2. Will not stay here again."

Columbus,39.969219,-82.999881,Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,4.0,"I really liked this hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was especially clean. I get grossed out easily and nothing here grossed me out (I didn't even wear my flip flops in the shower). We ended up staying in two different Drury Inns over the weekend. This was our choice as the hot tub was out of order in the first hotel and we really wanted to spend the evening in a hot tub. The first night we stayed at the Drury Inn in Grove City which was a 10-15 minute drive. That hotel was recently remodeled, so the rooms there were fresh looking and had a new feel to them. The Drury Inn downtown had the same great layout, but was just older. Both places had free popcorn and soda, a free happy hour (get the wine), and served free food throughout the day, which helps you save a little on food during your stay."
Long Beach,33.78864,-118.189464,Best Western of Long Beach,3.0,The staff were very friendly and willing. Breakfast satisfying. In fairness because of the hotel being under renovations it is hard to rate the condition as it is obvious that it will be better.
San Antonio,29.487838,-98.583884,Fiesta Inn and Suites,1.0,"From first sight, it looks old & beaten up. But I still decided to take a chance. Walked into the lobby to check in & there was a lot of strangers walking in & out. Once I got my key & went into the room, the room smelled like someone had died in there. There was dead bugs on the floor, the TV cables were cut open, no door to the restroom, the restroom smelled beyond disgusting & the windows were broken but taped. My husband and I were so mad, we went back to cancel and get out money back. DO NOT stay here. It's very shady and disgusting. Never again. They should be reported."

The young man at the desk found the confirmation and said it was for the 29th, I told them no it wasn't and, again, showed the reservation email. The young man told me it was 55.88, but my email told me 54.88. I said I would just pay the extra dollar. The lady asked me how many people, I told her 3. She then told me it wasn't going to be the quoted price of 54.88/ 55.88 but 69. I told her she might want to let Expedia know that the prices on Expedia's site is incorrect. I left and called Expedia, the representative from Economy Inn would not let the reservation be cancelled and they charged me for the night anyway!!! This place is a scam!!

Branson,36.65133,-93.26739,Days Inn Branson / Near The Strip,5.0,"Very enjoyable stay. Room very clean and comfortable, staff were very accommodating, excellent breakfast ."
Incline Village,39.244493,-119.936437,Parkside Inn At Incline,3.0,"Nice updates but very thin walls. I could hear the man snoring all night in the room above me. Very nice staff, breakfast O.K., would appreciate yogurt with a little less sugar, stronger coffee and some eggs would be nice. For the price and in Tahoe, what can you expect, a chef on hand with a omelet bar would be sweet. Good location for the Shakespeare Festival."
Newburgh,41.505388,-74.073291,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,1.0,Fasely advertised by the pictures from the Internet versus real life. Scarey looking at first sight looks abandoned.
Monroe,32.49375,-92.08275,Comfort Suites,4.0,"Everything was great except the carpets was a bit dirty. Every time we walked around bare footed, our feet turned black but this was the only issue. Overall a very nice room :)"
Medina,37.850643,15.293988,Villa Carlotta,5.0,"This was our first - but not last - trip to Sicily and we really didn't know what to expect. We took the train from Rome to Palermo and then drove to Taormina and couldn't believe the views from our apartment (the hotel proper was closed). From snow topped Mt. Etna to our right, to the sea at our feet, it was truly breathtaking. Day excursions to Siracuse, Mt. Etna and Castlemola plus a day just wandering around town made for an unforgettable vacation. The views from Etna and Castlemola were simply breathtaking - as was the drive up narrow, winding roads! Another pleasant surprise was the quality of Sicilian wines. The luxury apartments of the Villa Carlota were first class is all respects. Simona and Riccardo were absolutely first class in making us feel at home and helping us with recommendations on dining and sightseeing trips. Could not ask for two better hosts. We will be going back, maybe next time to try the hotel."
San Clemente,33.437538,-117.621732,Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,4.0,Searched for hotels in the San Clemente or San Juan Capistrano area thru trip advisor. This Holiday inn came up. We decided to stay there. Great hotel. Very clean. The staff was friendly and helped us selecting a good seafood restaurant on the water. The only drawback it is hard to find. The GPS takes you to a residential area... More
Albany,42.718398,-73.833766,Days Inn and Suites Albany,1.0,"We checked into our room, looked at the condition it was in, and left. We did not stay. Check in was awkward, as the front desk person was insulting and possibly high. When he looked at my ID he said This is you You look good. You know, in your picture only. Direct quote. The room was gross. The walls were grimy, the mirror on the door broken, the carpet was filthy, and there were holes in the bed linens. We left almost immediately. I was so put off by the rude front desk, I didn't even try to get my money back. We just fled."
Huntersville,35.44025,-80.87268,Candlewood Suites Huntersville,3.0,We were warmly greeted. The H/C room 123 is in the middle of the hallway not close to either entrance. Housekeeping only provides service once in 7 days. Housekeeping did not report problems we had with the shower or mention the sink drain was clogged. The refrigerator was very noisy and woke me up. Dresser drawer was busted.
Irvine,33.67971,-117.837279,Residence Inn By Marriott Irvine John Wayne Airport,5.0,"We chose Residence Inn by Marriott Irvine basically for its convenient location near the airport. Because of the convenient and complimentary hotel shuttle, it allowed us to make our visit to Orange County without having to rent a car. A local cab took us to our primary social event of that week-end. In addition to the convenience of the location, we were totally pleased to find our accommodations so exceptional as well as being able to enjoy the host of amenities that were offered by the hotel. And lastly, I cannot overlook the staff. They were exceptional people - and those include the breakfast area hosts who keep the area always stocked and continually tidy throughout the various time frames of breakfast. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would choose Residence Inn by Marriott Irvine again on our next visit."
Castle Rock,39.408529,-104.866775,Days Inn & Suites Castle Rock,1.0,"Booked for 2 days. Came back the first night theroom was dirty, beds were not made, floor not vacuumed and trash not thrown."
Annapolis,38.97555,-76.54838,Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,5.0,"We stayed here for our trip to sight-see around DC. Hotel was great, we stayed in a suite which was perfect for our family of 4.

Westmont,41.81644,-87.955,Extended Stay America - Chicago - Westmont - Oak Brook,4.0,I had a great stay besides the fire alarm being pulled and we were outside the hotel for about an hour for no reason. We were safe is how I logic that situation. Nice relaxing staycation for hubby and I.

Brookings,44.31141,-96.76286,Days Inn Brookings,2.0,I travel for a living and I would have to tell you that I would rather sleep in my car than to stay at this hotel again.
Columbus,39.969219,-82.999881,Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,5.0,"This was my first stay in a Drury hotel, and I was very pleased. The room was very spacious we had a double queen suite, so there was plenty of room for all of us (2 queens and a pull out). It was a little clunky getting to the bathroom in the middle of the night because of the placement... More"
San Antonio,29.487838,-98.583884,Fiesta Inn and Suites,1.0,"Filthy kitchen, filthy fridge, filthy oven, filthy living room, lumpy uneven beds, only one towel for a room with four guests and two beds, no continental breakfast (despite the sign outside saying so,) no batteries in the TV remote, no mat to wipe your feet save for a shredded up towel that was soaked through by the rain anyway. Leaks all over the bathroom, there was a puddle from the moment we walked in. To top it all off, they refused to do a refund despite us staying in the room for only 2 hours, and didn't try moving to another room (like I would trust the hotel anymore.) They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.) Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess. I'll be disputing this with my bank. Meanwhile, never book this hotel. Any of you. Whole place should be closed down and sold to somebody who knows how to run a business."
Grand Prairie,32.783764,-97.06028,Best Western Plus Arlington North Hotel and Suites,3.0,"The hotel is clean and comfortable. For the price paid I was expecting a bigger room and more upscale facility. The shuttle worked really well for us and the driver was super nice and helped us with the many pieces of luggage we had. The personal of front desk were not courteous, and seemed rather unprofessional (or maybe under training). Overall, if you need a clean but small room, and find it at a good rate, this hotel would work fine."
Long Beach,33.78864,-118.189464,Best Western of Long Beach,5.0,"We had a great time everything was great, breakfast was awesome with great service, the only thing was the couch in room was dirty with urine."

Fond Du Lac,43.75521,-88.47649,Holiday Inn Fond Du Lac,3.0,"This was once the premier hotel in Fond du Lac, however, it is trapped in 1993 and can't get out. This is a shame because the bed was comfortable, the room was clean,  and only a few touch ups (see photos) could make it nice again. Try the Holiday Inn Express next store, news hotel."
Long Beach,33.78864,-118.189464,Best Western of Long Beach,4.0,I stayed at Long Beach Best Western for 2 nights in January 2016. Highlights - 1) Clean remodeled rooms 2) Comfortable beds 3) Amazing breakfast 4) Friendly staff 5) Close to DTLB. I highly recommend this hotel to other travellers.

San Clemente,33.437538,-117.621732,Holiday Inn Express San Clemente,5.0,Short stay was extremely easy and efficient to book. Staff was friendly and the rooms was clean and organized. Arrived over two hours before our check-in time and were promptly given a room anyway. Great stay!
Harrisburg,40.277723,-76.821103,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,4.0,"Trip was for business, very good location to get to where you need to go in the area, many restaurants within a 2 miles of the hotel. Rooms very clean, hotel more than what was expected"
Boise,43.608151,-116.192184,Courtyard By Marriott Downtown Boise,4.0,"This hotel is a clean place to stay if you need to be close to the Boise State campus. It is about a 1 mile walk from the stadium (east) side of campus, if you're going for a football game or concert. It is a bit of walk to the central part of downtown. Close to many restaurants. The rooms... More"
Ruther Glen,37.93338,-77.47601,Days Inn Ruther Glen Kings Dominion Area,2.0,"It is truly run down and not much is being done to keep it up. The pool is OK but the dividing rope is bolted in so no laps. The lines and towels are frayed, scratchy and yellowed. The free breakfast is good and the staff is pleasant. The price is right but could be lower considering."
San Antonio,29.487838,-98.583884,Fiesta Inn and Suites,1.0,The room I got was an efficiency with two rooms. The A/C was in one room an it was hot the bedroom. I just wasn't what I booked. The price was outrageous for what I got.
Prescott Valley,34.585531,-112.326875,Arizona Inn of Prescott Valley,1.0,"The room next to us had many visitors all hours of the day and night, pretty sure it involved drugs. Some of the visitors were repeat customers. One of them was so messed up he was knocking on our door, he was tattooed from head to toe, including his shaved head. I also noticed a couple of them had teardrop tats. One morning there was vomit in front of our door. Never again!"
Lavonia,34.444512,-83.120563,Hotel Lavonia,4.0,"The Econo Lodge provided exactly what I needed. I was on my way from Raleigh, NC to Athens for the UGA football game. It was less than an hours drive. I only needed a good, clean place to get some sleep. The room was very clean and comfortable...a much better bargain than the Holiday Inn Express which would have cost over $100.00 more than what I paid. The desk manager was very personable. I would stay again."
Birmingham,33.520234,-86.808538,Hampton Inn & Suites-downtown-tutwiler,3.0,We were a little disappointed in our stay. There were pros and cons throughout. We were not comfortable walking anywhere from our hotel and thought the neighborhood was rough. We got a cab to Alabama theatre for that reason. Hotel was not kept up well but staff assistance made up for it. There is valet but no one to help you with you bags to your room. The restaurant food was good so that was a plus. Doubt we will be back.
Cambridge,42.374972,-71.110408,A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,4.0,"The host was great. The location is close to Harvard Sq. With plenty of great restaurants around. Parking was on the street, but not too inconvenient."
Carlstadt,40.832467,-74.08601,Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites Meadowlands Area,4.0,"Hotel was fine, nothing too exciting. Close to NYC via uber so that was great. Staff was nice. Pool was good. Breakfast was perfect. Do not rely on the bar/restaurant next door as an option. It is a nightclub and they frisk you for weapons. Steer clear."
Telluride,37.933273,-107.850865,Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,5.0,"My wife and I, along with our dogs, visit Telluride, CO twice a year. We have done this since 20010.

Newburgh,41.505388,-74.073291,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,3.0,It's an older place. People were pleasant and helpful. Not the cleanest bathroom really needs some up grades.
Austin,30.373974,-97.98694,Lakeway Resort & Spa,3.0,"We traveled with two small kids and wanted something family friendly as this resort boasted to be when researching it. The pros - nice view of the lake, comfortable bed and nice big room with a comfy chair, desk, and free wifi. The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food, it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone...they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out...we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED! Nowhere did it mention that it's only open Fri-Sun, AND that you have pay 10/hr as a hotel guest for a bunch of bounce houses, a dirty baby area, and a ping pong table. Really While 10 an hour isn't a lot, that's exactly the point - why in the WORLD would you CHARGE your guess for this Ridiculous. Bottom line, the room was nice, the pool was ok - but I wouldn't come back to this hotel again."
Telluride,37.933273,-107.850865,Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,5.0,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom for 3 nights in early Feb 2016 and we loved it.

No need to have a... More"
Medina,37.850643,15.293988,Villa Carlotta,5.0,"We made reservations based on the recommendation of friends who stayed here two months before us. Soon after making our reservation on-line I received a call from the hotel staff saying they would be closed for renovations, but they could put us up in an apartment and the staff would be available at the hotel for anything we needed. The apartment was fabulous and contained everything we could possibly need. Simona, our main contact,was full of personality and warmth. She made us happy to be there. I can't say enough about this hotel. We wanted to ask the people on staff including the owner to have dinner with us!! We were here between New Years and Epiphany and didn't realize how much would be closed. The staff made everything work for us. Go to Taormina...it's geourgous! and stay at Hotel Villa Carlotta!!"
Newburgh,41.505388,-74.073291,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,1.0,"I ended up here because there were no other options for a no smoking room. Upon arrival, the toilet had been used and not completely flushed. The bathroom was old and badly in need of repair. The second day ( Had I not been locked into Expedia, there wouldn't have been a second day!!!!) there was garbage by the garbage can that hadn't been removed. The entire room felt dirty. I will never stay at another Howard Johnson or use Expedia again. This experience was horrible."

Elko,40.843764,-115.751013,Super 8 Elko Nv,2.0,"I have stayed in a lot of Super 8 motels, and apply my standard to these budget stays appropriately. That being said, this location was by far the worst I have stayed at. Elko in general was quite run down, but this location was very sub par compared to all others I have stayed at. On a good note, the staff was very kind and accommodating. Would not stay here again."
West Palm Beach,26.697607,-80.072864,Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,4.0,Room was good except that my room faced the highway and heard cars and trucks go by thru out the night

Columbia Falls,48.36373,-114.15178,Western Inn-glacier Park,3.0,"The hotel features a western facing entrance. This raises the rooms temperature on hot days. The rooms air conditioning air output seems labored for its size. After removing the filter grate I discovered the the filter was clogged with particulate matter. It looked like the filter hadn't been cleaned in years. Needless to say the unit worked better after I cleaned the filter in the tub. Thanks to the western exposure the room didn't cool down until the sun set around 9:30. I also clogged the tub with the matter that I washed from the filter. It took twenty minutes to remove the material, by hand, to restore my tub to working order."
Boiling Springs,35.011314,-81.954798,Americas Best Value Inn,3.0,"breakfirst is very soso, and rooms have not refrig, and one of the two elevators is out of work, but the location is good and staff is nice...."
Santa Barbara,34.428888,-119.707704,Simpson House Inn,5.0,"The Simpson House Inn is a charming bed and breakfast just a few blocks from State street in Santa Barbara. We spent an absolutely wonderful weekend relaxing and enjoying the beautiful grounds and atmosphere. All the rooms are different -- we stayed in the Katherine McCormick room which was cozy and very comfortable. However, what really sets this place apart is the staff. Personal touches are everywhere and make a huge difference to your stay. Also, the food is amazing! We will certainly be back if given the opportunity. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying their stay at this wonderful Inn."
Palermo,38.160424,13.331846,Hotel Casena Dei Colli,4.0,"The grounds were beautiful, and my room was clean and modern. I believe I was staying there during an off season, so it was nice and quiet. My one complaint was that the internet was spotty, but I find this to be the case in most hotels in Italy. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Palermo. It was a great value for the money and a very pleasant atmosphere."
Oak Harbor,48.288952,-122.657842,Acorn Motor Inn,3.0,We spent the weekend here. Nice furnishings and the bathroom was very clean. No elevator so you have to carry everything up the stairs and breakfast comes out of a toaster. Nothing to write home about but it is an OK place to rest.
Annapolis,38.97555,-76.54838,Hampton Inn and Suites Annapolis,5.0,"Generally close to Annapolis, without the hustle of tourists. Well kept and clean, with a good breakfast. Business/computer systems available and easy to use. All parking is close to the entrance of the hotel."

Southport,33.9534,-78.0521,Comfort Suites Southport,5.0,Really enjoyed our stay. The beds are very comfy and the staff very friendly. The lady that cooked breakfast named Vicki did an awesome job on breakfast and was helpful to us with questions we had about the island.
West Deptford,39.83456,-75.08841,Residence Inn By Marriott Deptford,5.0,"Hotel was very quiet, and the 1 and 2 bedroom suites are very nice for families. I really appreciated the microwave and refrigerator as that helped to ensure we had the option to not spend every meal dining out. The sofa was a fold out bed which, while not the most comfortable way to sleep, was a great option that allowed me to save by not getting a 2 bedroom suite. There is also a simple breakfast which included the ability to make your own waffles. We had to extend our stay at the last minute and the hotel staff was very accommodating. It was also a big plus that there is a coin operated laundry onsite, that we were happy to make use of. There are good options for groceries (to fill that fridge) and dinning nearby. In short, if you need to stay in the area, this is a really good option."
