/* This is a sample script for loading and scoring machine learning models using New York taxi data.
   The query scenario is to predict the fare for taking a trip around New York City.
   First, create two tables: to store the sample machine learning model and scoring data.
   Next, load the data and the model in their respective tables.
   Last, use T-SQL Predict to score the model.
   Run the script below to see the results.
